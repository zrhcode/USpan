# USpan
USpan (Yin et al, 2012) is a famous algorithm for discovering high-utility sequential patterns in a sequence database containing utility information.

## Requirements
Java programming language

## Running the program
A simple way is to run the java MainTestUSapn file

## Benchmarks
- Additional datasets can be accessed from [SPMF](http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=datasets.php).

## Where can I get more information about the USPAN algorithm?
This is the article describing the USPAN algorithm:
